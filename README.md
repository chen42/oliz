# Oliz: selecting 50mer oligonucleotides for microarrays

Oliz is a suite of Perl scripts that selects 50mer oligonucleotides for use in DNA microarrays. Its features include:
* Uses UniGene cluster ID as input. 
* Selects 50mers from the 3'untranslated region.
* Filters 50mers through automated blast search for gene specificity. 
* Oliz is free for use in academic institutions. Commercial users please contact the authors for availability. 
* OS: written for Linux/Unix; May work under Mac OS X (haven't been tested); Not compatible with MS Windows. 

A paper describing Oliz is available from  <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/27"> BMC Bioinformatics</a>.  The original server hosting the code no longer exists.  We placed the code here for archival purpose.
